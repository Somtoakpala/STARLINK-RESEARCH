\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
Considering the unique context of Nigeria, this paper explores a comprehensive performance evaluation of the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite system Starlink, with the focus being on its operational effectiveness. This study used a qualitative technique to examine many performance characteristics, such as Jitter, Packet Loss, Throughput, Routing Strategy, Latency, Generic Data Transfer, and Environmental Influential Factors.\\ \\
Our goal is to provide significant insights into the real-world uses and performance of Starlink's technology in Nigeria through this research. It is anticipated that the results would provide insight into the performance dynamics of satellite systems to academics, stakeholders, enabling them to make well-informed decisions in the constantly changing telecommunications industry.
